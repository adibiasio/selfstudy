# Computer Science

This is a record of my efforts to self-study various topics within Computer Science. My main goal with this ongoing project is to supplement the knowledge I learned from courses during my time at [Georgia Tech](https://github.com/adibiasio/gatech) with both more advanced topics building on what I already know and unfamiliar ones with which I did not have the chance to interact with yet.

Currently, I'm following along with [this](https://teachyourselfcs.com) guide.
